This is a Udacity Nanodegree Data Scientist Project.
Installation

The program code runs under Python 3.*. It requires the following Python libraries:
import numpy
import pandas
from collections import Counter
import matplotlib.pyplot
import seaborn
import warnings

The required Stackoverflow Annual Developer Survey data for 2020, 2021, 2022 is available for download here.

Project Motivation
This is the Udacity Nanodegree Project Writing a Data Scientist blog post. My interest was to use the Stackoverflow Developer Survey Data to better understand the following issues:

How has the use of the Python programming language developed in Germany in recent years?
How has the popularity of the Python programming language developed in Germany in recent years?
How does the Python programming language used at work currently relate to programming languages that people want to learn?

File Description
PythonAnalysis.ipynb: Notebook containing the data analysis.
data/2020/survey_results_public.csv: Stackoverflow's 2020 Annual Developer Survey data. 
data/2021/survey_results_public.csv: Stackoverflow's 2021 Annual Developer Survey data.
