The required Stackoverflow Annual Developer Survey data for 2020, 2021, 2022 is available for download [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).

### Project Motivation

This is the Udacity Nanodegree Project Writing a Data Scientist blog post. My interest was to use the Stackoverflow Developer Survey Data to better understand the following issues:

1. How has the use of the Python programming language developed in Germany in recent years?  
2. How has the popularity of the Python programming language developed in Germany in recent years?
3. How does the Python programming language used at work currently relate to programming languages that people want to learn?
